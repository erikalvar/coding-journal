Today I read a Medium article by Tom Smykowski about Ruby 3.2.0 and the updates that it included. This update happened on 12/25/22. Although I haven't used some of the features that were updated such as Regex I did underestand how some of the others would be useful. One is that the compiler, now YJIT is up to 41% faster. Shopify which uses Ruby heavily is up to 39% faster because of YJIT. Another update that helps me as someone who still makes a lot of mistakes when I'm rushing through things is that when 'ends' are missing because of deleted 'ifs' or 'fors,' Ruby helps to indicate where those missing might be. The article also indicated that Rails was updated to 7.0.4 on 9/22/22 and I'm excited to see what changes were made.
